# Competitive-Programming
> The aim of this repo is to help people to get to know CP better.
> CP is awesome .. you'll never regret it .

There is a lot from CP to explore .. so maybe a list of contents ?

## List of Contents 

* [Basics](#Basics)
* [Starting](#Starting)
* [Consistency](#Consistency)
* [Cracking Coding Competitions](#Cracking_Coding_Competitons)

## Basics 
> Many people fear CP ! It's actually great fun.

First of all what is CP ?, Its all about solving problems 
All you need is one good programming language to start with and lots of passion.
If you are just figuring out what CP is, dont be worried everybody will get the hang of it.
> Some of my favourite videos on youtube which give an good idea of Comp Sci are :
* [Rachit Jain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl86tYr7emg)
* [CS Dojo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mElVGah7Epg)

These videos help a lot..please do check them out !

## Starting 

> After taking up one programming language, you can watch youtube tutorials to get an in-depth view of that particular programming lanuage
Some recommended youtube videos are :
* [For begginers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CpG3oATGIs)
> After that you can go practice real time as you already have enough experience on one of the programming languages. 
The paltforms on which you can practice coding are ( suggested sequence ):
* [Hackerrank](hackerrank.com)
* [Codechef](codechef.com)
* [Code Forces](codeforces.com)
One suggestion would be in Codeforces you could try long challenges and then can jump to short challenges. 

Other platforms to practice : 
* [topcoder](topcoder.com)
*
*
*

You can practice on any platform you like ! Its all about exploring.

## Consistency 

> Consistency is the key here too, a lot of people fail at this stage. That is because they don't get to know how fun solving differnt problems is 

Some good practices for maintaining consistency are : 
* Figuring out which platform intrests you. 
* Exploring different Algorithms and Data Structures.
* Checking out some good texts about CP.
* Commitment, Determination are the keys to success.

## Cracking_Coding_Competions 

> Once you have enough practice you can participate in Coding Competitons either online or offline
Coding competitons are held almost everytime in Coding Platforms such as :
* [Hackerrank](hackerrank.com)
* [Codechef](codechef.com)
* [Code Forces](codeforces.com)
* [topcoder](topcoder.com)
> There is also a website for the live and ongoing coding competions [clist.by](clist.by)
> Also check out the extension on firefox called [Coder's Calendar](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/coder-s-calendar/?src=search)
Apart from these regular ones, there are other worldwide competitions such as : 
* [Google Kickstart](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart) There are many rounds for this. You can try starting here for global challenges
* [Google Hash Code](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode)
* [Google Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam) *THIS IS THE TOP CODING COMPETITION FOR GOOGLE* 
* [India's top Coding Contest](https://www.techgig.com/codegladiators) CODE GLADIATORS
* [Facebook Hacker Cup](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup/)
* [ACM ICPC](https://icpc.baylor.edu/) This is also top level 
Cracking a coding contest is all about participation. Anyone won't get first prize in their first participation. All you've to have is patience
